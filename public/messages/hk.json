We start by sourcing recycled materials for the construction of the car simulation, ensuring that the materials we use have minimal impact on the environment. We then incorporate green energy sources to reduce our carbon footprint and promote renewable energy. Our team works to optimize the energy efficiency of the car simulation to further minimize its impact on the environment. We aim to demonstrate that sustainable practices can be integrated into everyday technologies such as cars, and that they can be both practical and environmentally responsible."
