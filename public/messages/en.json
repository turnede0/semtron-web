      "description": "Our approach to developing a car simulation using green energy and recycled materials is to prioritize sustainability and environmental consciousness throughout the entire process. We start by sourcing recycled materials for the construction of the car simulation, ensuring that the materials we use have minimal impact on the environment. We then incorporate green energy sources to reduce our carbon footprint and promote renewable energy. Our team works to optimize the energy efficiency of the car simulation to further minimize its impact on the environment. We aim to demonstrate that sustainable practices can be integrated into everyday technologies such as cars, and that they can be both practical and environmentally responsible."

      "description": "The normal vehicle life cycle follows a linear process: manufacture, use, and dispose. Once a vehicle has reached the end of its useful life, it is typically scrapped and sent to a landfill, where it takes up valuable space and contributes to environmental pollution. This process results in a significant waste of resources, as many components of the vehicle are still usable or recyclable."

Its objective is to achieve the waste reduction policy goals outlined in the Hong Kong Blueprint by addressing the bottlenecks and constraints in the industry. Ultimately, the fund seeks to increase the quantity and quality of recyclables recovered from the waste stream and improve the quality of recycled products, thereby reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills.",
      "title": "How does circular vehicle lifecycle works?",
      "content": "With the support of Recycling Fund, we,team of aerosim start a new project \"sim Auto\". The vehicle life cycle in the SIM Auto project follows a more circular process: manufacture, use, extract, and reuse. Once a vehicle has reached the end of its useful life, it is dismantled, and the reusable parts are extracted for educational purposes in car simulation. These parts can be used to teach users about driving skills and the inner workings of a vehicle."

      "description": "Our project revolves around the unique approach of creating a car simulator using authentic car components. To make this possible, we have undertaken extensive efforts in reverse engineering the control signals of the Mini Cooper R56 system. This breakthrough technology enables us to interface hardware components with simulation data seamlessly. By repurposing discarded car parts and extending their life cycle, we are not only reducing waste and cutting down on carbon emissions, but also creating an immersive and authentic driving experience for drivers. Reverse engineering is a critical technology that has played a significant role in the success of our project.\nMQTT Control Unit:\nWe have also incorporated innovative technologies like the MQTT control unit into our system. This cutting-edge technology provides internet connectivity, enabling wireless real-time remote control and data logging. With the MQTT control unit, users can easily monitor and adjust their simulation setup from anywhere, making it more convenient and user-friendly. This feature has enhanced the overall experience of our car simulator, making it more accessible to a wider audience. By incorporating the MQTT control unit, we have also aligned ourselves with the principles of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), as it enables us to create a more sustainable and efficient system.",
